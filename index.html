The only thing I can say now is sorry, and show change. If any of this sways you, please call me if you want. The only things I will make you feel is happiness. Let me be the one you play minecraft with, im a better builder than all these hoes. Let me be the one to play valorant with you. Theres no expectations, the only thing I will do is make you happy. These last few weeks have killed me. Let's be happy, Nao. I'll change, only apologizes for my mistakes. None of this is ur fault. The onlt thing I should of done was say I was sorry, and beg for forgivness and change. Not blame you or make excuses. what I did was wrong and I can only change from here. I will fix my communication and intimacy issues and be the one for you Nao. Like this picture I sent to you. The stars remind me of you. You will forever be in my mind cause the stars dont vanish. The night will always about be you. When I look at them all I see is your beautiful smile.</p>
